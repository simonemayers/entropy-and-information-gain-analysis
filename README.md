# Entropy and Information Gain Analysis

This repository contains R code demonstrating the calculation of **entropy and information gain** for a dataset derived from the word "OXYMORON". The project applies fundamental concepts of information theory to analyze uncertainty and information reduction in a dataset.

## Project Overview

The code provides a practical application of **entropy** and **information gain calculations** in R, using a simple example to illustrate these concepts. This analysis is crucial for understanding data features in more complex machine learning and data science tasks.

## Features

- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures the randomness or uncertainty in the dataset.
- **Information Gain Calculation**: Determines the reduction in entropy when the dataset is split into categories (vowels and consonants in this case).
- **Data Segmentation Analysis**: Examines how data segmentation affects the overall information structure.

## Technical Details

The code uses the following approach:
1. **Frequency and Probability Distribution**: Converts raw frequency data from the word "OXYMORON" into a probability distribution.
2. **Entropy Computation**: Calculates entropy using the `entropy` package in R.
3. **Subgroup Analysis**: Splits the data into vowels and consonants to calculate entropy for each group.
4. **Weighted Entropy and Information Gain**: Computes weighted entropy for the combined groups and calculates the information gain from the segmentation.

## Prerequisites

- **R**: Install R and necessary packages to run the code.
- **Required R Packages**: Install the `entropy` package:
  ```r
  install.packages("entropy")
  ```

## How to Run

To execute the analysis, clone this repository and run the R script in an environment that supports R, such as RStudio:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/entropy-information-gain.git
cd entropy-information-gain
# Run the R script
```

## File Structure

- `entropy_analysis.R`: The main R script containing the code for entropy and information gain calculations.
